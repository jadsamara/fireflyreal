        Your safety is our top priority. Hereâ€™s how we ensure a secure
        environment:

      <FaqCardText>
        Two-Factor Authentication: Every user undergoes two-factor verification
        to confirm their identity.
      </FaqCardText>
      <Br />
      <FaqCardText>
        ID Verification: We employ an ID verification system for an added layer
        of security.
      </FaqCardText>
      <Br />
      <FaqCardText>
        Address Visibility Options: Hosts can choose to keep the exact address
        of their Spark private, sharing it only with accepted participants.
      </FaqCardText>
      <Br />
      <FaqCardText>
        Mandatory Review System: After each Spark, participants are required to
        leave a review. This holds everyone accountable and helps maintain a
        trustworthy community.
      </FaqCardText>
      <Br />
      <FaqCardText>
        By implementing these measures, we strive to create a safe and enjoyable
        experience for all our users.
